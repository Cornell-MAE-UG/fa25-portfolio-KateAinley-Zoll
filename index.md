## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/FSAE Headshot 2.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with hands-on experience in design, manufacturing, and teamwork across academic, professional, and extracurricular settings. As an Aerodynamics Design Engineer with Cornell’s Formula SAE Racing team, I’ve contributed to advanced engineering projects while also gaining practical experience in prosthetics and orthotics during my internship at Shriners Children’s Hospital. Beyond engineering, I’ve shared my voice as a published author and invited speaker on perseverance in STEM. With skills in technical design, machining, and computational tools like Autodesk Inventor and Ansys CFD, I bring creativity, discipline, and leadership to every project I take on.
