As part of a class project we were given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tal. We had to choose a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear
actuator, and design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid. I chose the RSX Actuator with a force up to 294KN.


This is how I solved the problem:

```python
    some code = 10;
    plot();
```
