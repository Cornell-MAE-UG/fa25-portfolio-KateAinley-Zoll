For this project we chose to analyze a **rocket-engine diffuser**. The diffuser is the downstream geometry that receives the high-speed exhaust from a converging–diverging rocket nozzle and slows it down in a controlled way so that kinetic energy is converted into static pressure or used for mixing and flow conditioning.

## How a Jet Diffuser Works
A **jet diffuser** is widely used in HVAC systems, aircraft engine test cells, and propulsion test facilities wherever a high-speed jet of air must be slowed down smoothly and efficiently.
- As the flow enters the diffuser, the **cross-sectional area gradually increases**.
- Because mass flow is (approximately) conserved, the **flow velocity decreases** as area increases.
- The reduction in velocity converts **kinetic energy into static pressure** – this is called **pressure recovery**.
- To keep this process efficient, the flow must remain **attached** to the diffuser walls.
- If the **expansion (divergence) angle** is too large, the boundary layer separates, producing turbulence, energy loss, and a sharp drop in pressure recovery.
The diffuser’s performance is usually characterized by a **pressure-recovery coefficient**, which measures how effectively the diffuser converts velocity head into static pressure. Its value is very sensitive to both geometry and operating conditions:
- Increasing the expansion angle makes the diffuser **shorter and more compact**, but greatly **increases the risk of flow separation**, reducing pressure recovery.
- Using a smaller expansion angle keeps the flow attached and **improves efficiency**, but requires a **longer diffuser**.
- Higher inlet velocities provide more kinetic energy to recover, but also make the flow more prone to separation.
- Surface roughness and very large area ratios increase losses and can further reduce efficiency.
Overall, a jet diffuser performs best when its design promotes **smooth, gradual deceleration** with attached, steady flow.

## Qualitative Description in a Rocket-Engine Context
In a rocket-engine application, the diffuser is placed **downstream of the nozzle** and is designed either to:
- decelerate and interrogate the **supersonic exhaust plume** inside a test stand, or
- enable **mixing and pressure recovery** in air-augmented or altitude-compensating propulsion systems.
Key qualitative features:
- The exhaust leaves the converging–diverging nozzle at **high Mach number** and enters a larger-area diffuser.
- Inside the diffuser, the flow experiences **controlled deceleration** through a combination of:
  - gradual **area expansion**,
  - **oblique or normal shocks** (for supersonic regimes),
  - and **mixing** with entrained ambient air.
- The goal is to convert **dynamic pressure into higher static pressure** or to produce a flow state that can be safely exhausted, measured, or further processed.
Performance depends strongly on:
- the **shock structure** (location and strength of shocks),
- **boundary-layer growth** along the walls,
- whether the flow remains **quasi-attached** through the expansion.
Flow separation or unsteady shock motion leads to large losses, high entropy generation, and poor diffuser performance.

## Mass and Energy Balance
We treat the diffuser and the immediate rocket-exhaust region as a **steady-flow control volume**.
### Mass balance
The total mass flow rate is conserved between inlet (1) and outlet (2):

$$
\dot{m}_1 = \dot{m}_2
$$
At the outlet, the flow may consist of **nozzle exhaust plus entrained air**:
$$

\dot{m}_2 = \dot{m}_\text{exhaust} + \dot{m}_\text{entrained}
$$
### Steady-flow energy equation
The general steady-flow energy balance for the control volume is
$$
\dot{m}\left(h_1 + \frac{V_1^2}{2} + g z_1\right)
+ \dot{Q} - \dot{W}_s
=
\dot{m}\left(h_2 + \frac{V_2^2}{2} + g z_2\right)
+ \dot{E}_\text{loss}
$$
For the diffuser we typically assume:
- shaft work is negligible, \\( \dot{W}_s \approx 0 \\)
- elevation changes are small, $ z_1 \approx z_2 $
- heat transfer is small compared to the flow energy
Under these assumptions, the balance simplifies to
$$
\dot{m}\left(h_1 + \frac{V_1^2}{2}\right)
\;\approx\;
\dot{m}\left(h_2 + \frac{V_2^2}{2}\right)
+ \dot{E}_\text{loss}
$$
### Bernoulli-style form with losses
For a single-phase flow we can rewrite the same physics in a Bernoulli-style relation that includes a head-loss term \\(h_L\\):
$$
p_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho_1 V_1^2 + \rho_1 g z_1
=
p_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho_2 V_2^2 + \rho_2 g z_2 + \rho\,h_L
$$
Here \\(h_L\\) represents losses from friction, mixing, shocks, and separation in the diffuser.
### Thrust relation and impact of the diffuser
The rocket thrust at the exit plane (before the diffuser) can be approximated by
$$
F = \dot{m}\,V_e + \left(p_e - p_\infty\right) A_e ,
$$
where \\(V_e\\) and \\(p_e\\) are the exhaust velocity and static pressure at the nozzle exit, \\(p_\infty\\) is ambient (test-cell) pressure, and \\(A_e\\) is the nozzle exit area.
A diffuser that **raises the downstream static pressure** (and therefore modifies \\(p_e\\) or the effective back pressure) will:
- change the pressure term \\(\left(p_e - p_\infty\right)A_e\\),
- modify the exit velocity \\(V_e\\),
- and therefore **change the net thrust and the engine/test-cell back-pressure condition**.
If the diffuser effectively raises static pressure downstream without causing severe losses, it increases the pressure contribution in the thrust relation while still allowing useful deceleration and conditioning of the exhaust.
---
## Entropy Balance and Irreversibility
For the same control volume, the **entropy balance** is
$$
\dot{m}\left(s_2 - s_1\right)
=
\dot{S}_\text{gen}
+
\frac{\dot{Q}}{T_\text{wall, avg}},
$$
<p>
where \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \ge 0 \) is the rate of entropy generation
and \( T_{\text{wall, avg}} \) is an average wall temperature where heat
transfer occurs.
</p>
If the heat transfer is small, the entropy change is dominated by irreversibilities:
$$
s_2 - s_1 \;\approx\; s_\text{gen} \ge 0 .
$$
Entropy generation in the diffuser comes from
- **viscous dissipation** in the boundary layer,
- **shock waves** in supersonic regions,
- **heating**, **mixing**, and **flow separation**.
Each of these irreversibilities **reduces total pressure** and the **effective recoverable work** that can be obtained from the flow, which is why minimizing separation and shock losses is crucial for a high-performance diffuser.

## Effect of Design and Operating Conditions on Performance
The performance of a jet-engine diffuser depends strongly on both **geometry** and **operating conditions**:
- **Divergence angle**
  - Increasing the divergence angle or surface roughness promotes **boundary-layer separation**, dramatically reducing pressure recovery and increasing total-pressure losses.
  - Using a smaller angle keeps the flow attached and **improves pressure recovery**, but makes the diffuser **longer and heavier**.
- **Inlet Mach number**
  - Higher inlet Mach numbers can enhance pressure recovery **if the internal flow remains subsonic**.
  - If the flow inside the diffuser becomes **supersonic**, shock waves form, causing large stagnation-pressure losses and possible flow unsteadiness.
- **Surface condition and area ratio**
  - Rough walls and very high area ratios increase viscous losses and make separation more likely.
  - Smooth surfaces and carefully chosen area ratios help maintain attached flow.
- **Ambient conditions / altitude**
  - At high altitudes, lower air density leads to larger boundary-layer thicknesses and a greater tendency to separate, reducing diffuser effectiveness.
In summary, diffuser performance is **optimal** when the internal flow is **attached, shock-free, and gradually decelerated**. Even small changes in geometry or operating conditions can noticeably impact **pressure recovery**, **losses**, and overall effectiveness of the rocket-engine test system.
